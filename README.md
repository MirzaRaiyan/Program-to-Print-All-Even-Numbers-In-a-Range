About How to Print All Even Numbers In a Range.

Given starting and end points, write a Python program to print all even numbers in that given range.

Example 1:
Input: start = 4, end = 15
Output: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14

Example 2:
Input: start = 8, end = 11
Output: 8, 10

Example #1: Print all even numbers from given list using for loop

Define start and end limit of range. Iterate from start till the range in the list using for loop and check if num % 2 == 0. If the condition satisfies, then only print the number.
